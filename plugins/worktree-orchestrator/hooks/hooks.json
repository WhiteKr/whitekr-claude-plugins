Before ending, you may inform the user about any worktrees that could be cleaned up.\n\nCleanup candidates typically include:\n- Worktrees with branches already merged to main/master\n- Worktrees with no uncommitted changes\n\nIf suggesting cleanup, use a format like:\n```\n📦 Worktree Cleanup Available\n\nThese worktrees have merged branches:\n• ../repo-feature-login [feature/login]\n\nWould you like to clean them up?\n```\n\nNote: Only suggest cleanup if the user hasn't already addressed this. Never force cleanup without user consent."
